# First Assignment of the Research Track 2 course (Robotics Engineering_5051520, Unige)
## Coppeliasim Package:
This package helps to control the robot in the Coppeliasim environment using 'got_to_point' behaviour.And a random goal poses is generated and robot aligns itself towards that point.it sets the linear velocity to drive to the goal position,and one the goal position is reached then it adjusts to attain the required angular position.if the robot is not stopped the process will be operated in a loop by generating new target destination and pose.the robot's 'go_to_point' is implemented as server.the robot can be stopped only when it reaches the goal and the robot will be restarted when the new goal is arrived.this process will be followed in continuous loop if the robot is given the 'stop' command. 

Child script for Coppeliasim:
- dr20_ros_ctrl:this file has code written in lua and it helps to control the dr20 mobile robot from the ros environment and it does not have action server implemented so when the 'stop' is given by the user,the robot will stop when it reaches the target.

Two nodes are implemented as python scripts:
- go_to_point: the node GoToPoint, which implements a service to drive a robot toward a point in the gazebo environment.This node publishes on the topics /cmd_vel the velocity of the robot and read its position by subscribing the topic '/odom'.
- user_interface: the UserInterface, which asks the user to start/stop the robot, and calls the service implemented in the Finite State Machine node.

Other two nodes are implemented in C++:
- position_server: the node PositionServer, which implements a random position service.The service implemented in the Position Server node replies with random values for x, y, and theta, where x and y should be limited between some minimum and maximum values.
- state_machine: The service implemented in the Robot FSM node gives the possibility to start or stop the robot behaviour.it monitors the request of a new goal pose when needed, sending it as a goal to 'go_to_point' action server.

## Command for Running the package:
1.A launch file has been provided to run all the ros nodes required for the control of robot in coppeliasim environment using ros:
- source ROS1 workspace.
- Vrep.launch: this launch file is used to launch all the required nodes.

```
roslaunch rt2_assignment1 vrep.launch
```
2.To open the coppeliasim application:
```../CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_Ubuntu20_04/.coppeliaSim.sh``` 
 - this command will open the coppeliasim simulation.
